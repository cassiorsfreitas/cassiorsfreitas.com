Well, I am not a designer. Not even a web designer. Everything I’m about to share here comes from a frontend developer who uses Neovim as an editor, so proceed at your own risk!

Over the past few months, I had the chance to put into practice many of the things I've already learned voluntarily about <strong>user experience</strong> and <strong>user interface</strong> topics. Beyond that, I got to explore tools like Figma and Adobe XD, create prototypes from scratch, and share some of the knowledge and results with my developer coworkers.

Because of that, I decided to compile and share all the sources and references I used during this period, along with some other nitpicks that might be relevant <strong>for those who want to dive into this topic but aren’t sure how much or where to start</strong>:

## To reflect on:

- 💭 I know that there isn’t always enough time to think about prototypes, and creating proof-of-concepts often becomes the first option. However, sketching out even your POC can be a great exercise to test basic knowledge, regardless of the chosen tool. It will also serve as a “discussion board” for you and other developers, giving you something visual to discuss about.
- 💭 Being comfortable with basic (really basic) concepts can help you understand what the design team is communicating and vice versa—it can help you expressing your ideas more effectively.
- 💭 When dabbling in design, consistency in colours, typography, and spacing can transform an amateur design into something professional. Establishing a basic design system, even if it’s minimal, helps to ensure that your projects remain visually cohesive, which ultimately benefits the user experience.

## Conclusion

I’m aware that beyond everything mentioned here, there are dozens of books, resources, and content that are also significantly important. However, as I mentioned earlier, these were my starting points, and I hope some of them can serve as yours as well.

Cheers!
